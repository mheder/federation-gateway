## Services and ports

| Service | Port | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| **UI** (nginx, SPA) | `8080` (configurable via `UI_PORT`) | Proxies `/api/*` → backend at `8765` |
| **Backend** (FastAPI) | `8765` (configurable via `BACKEND_PORT`) | BFF: auth + deployment config + proxy to instances |
| **LightHouse** | `8081` (configurable via `LIGHTHOUSE_PUBLIC_PORT`) | Federation node, digest-pinned in `docker-compose.yml` — check there for the current digest, it moves as we pick up upstream fixes |
| **LightHouse 2** | `8082` (configurable via `LIGHTHOUSE2_PUBLIC_PORT`) | A second, independent federation node/trust anchor |
| **Mesh** (`mesh-ta`/`mesh-ia`/`mesh-leaf-op`/`mesh-leaf-rp`) | `8090`–`8093` | A real multi-hop federation (TA → Intermediate → 2 leaves) — see `docs/FEDERATION-TOPOLOGY.md` |
| **Mesh2** (`mesh2-ta`/`mesh2-ia`/`mesh2-leaf-op`) | `8094`–`8096` | A second, fully independent hierarchy — for interfederation testing, see `docs/FEDERATION-TOPOLOGY.md` |
| **Mesh multi-parent** (`mesh-ia2`/`mesh-leaf-multi`) | `8097`–`8098` | A second Intermediate sibling to `mesh-ia`, and a leaf registered under both — for multiple-valid-trust-chains testing, see `docs/FEDERATION-TOPOLOGY.md` |

> **API flow**: Browser → nginx:8080 → FastAPI:8765 → LightHouse:8080 (internal Docker network)
> **Configuration**: Instances are defined in `backend/config/gateway.yaml` and loaded at backend startup.
> **Persistence**: `lighthouse/data/` (and the mesh equivalents) are bind-mounted runtime directories. The compose entrypoint ensures they're writable before LightHouse starts.

## Deployment configuration

Federation instances are declared in `backend/config/gateway.yaml`:

```yaml
instances:
  - id: ta-1
    name: LightHouse
    public_base_url: http://localhost:8081
    admin_base_url: http://lighthouse:8080
    public_port: 8081
    admin_port: 8080
    admin_auth:
      type: basic
      username_env: LIGHTHOUSE_ADMIN_USERNAME
      password_env: LIGHTHOUSE_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

**Key behaviors**:
- The backend loads instance configuration from `GATEWAY_CONFIG_FILE` (defaults to `/config/gateway.yaml` in Docker).
- Admin credentials are read from environment variables (`LIGHTHOUSE_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `LIGHTHOUSE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`).
- The UI does **not** auto-select the first instance. Users must explicitly choose an instance from the dropdown.
- Proxy requests to admin endpoints are authenticated server-side; the UI never sees admin credentials.
- A background probe on backend startup corrects each instance's stored `entity_id` if it differs from `public_base_url` (see `docs/FEDERATION-TOPOLOGY.md`).

### Default credentials (seeded on first run)

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | `admin@oidfed.org` | `admin123` |
| User | `tech@example.org` | `user123` |

The admin password is configurable (`ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` in
`.env`) — it's the only path to `super_admin` on a fresh database, so
change it before any real deployment. See `PRODUCTION-READINESS.md` #2.

---

## Quick start

```sh
python3 scripts/generate-secrets.py   # one-time — writes a gitignored .env
docker compose up -d --build
python3 scripts/migrate-lighthouse-config.py       # one-time per LightHouse image
python3 scripts/bootstrap-lighthouse-admin-users.py # one-time — idempotent
python3 scripts/seed-demo.py
python3 scripts/seed-mesh.py
python3 scripts/seed-mesh2.py
```

Opens at **http://localhost:8080**. This brings up all 13 services (ui,
backend, lighthouse, lighthouse2, and 9 mesh nodes across two independent
federations). Every command above is idempotent — safe to re-run any of
them if something fails partway. See `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` for the
guided first-run tour.

- `migrate-lighthouse-config.py`: LightHouse 0.22.x+ reads federation
  endpoint config from its own database, not live from `config.yaml` —
  skip this and every public endpoint (`/fetch`, `/list`, `/resolve`, ...)
  404s (`CLAUDE.md` hard constraint #13).
- `bootstrap-lighthouse-admin-users.py`: each LightHouse instance's admin
  API stays unauthenticated until its first user is created — this
  creates that one user per instance using the credentials from `.env`.
- `seed-*.py`: populate the demo federations with subordinates, trust
  marks, and (for the mesh scripts) real multi-hop hierarchies. Optional
  if you just want an empty stack to point at your own data.

**Required secrets**: `docker compose up` fails closed —
`LIGHTHOUSE_ADMIN_USERNAME`/`PASSWORD`, `LIGHTHOUSE2_ADMIN_USERNAME`/
`PASSWORD`, `OIDC_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and `JWT_SECRET` have no fallback
defaults (see `PRODUCTION-READINESS.md` #5 for why). `generate-secrets.py`
above handles this for local/demo use; see `.env.example` if you'd rather
set them by hand or wire in a real secrets manager for production.

**Other environment variables** (optional, all have working defaults):
```sh
UI_PORT=8080 \
BACKEND_PORT=8765 \
LIGHTHOUSE_PUBLIC_PORT=8081 \
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Minimal setup (3 containers, single trust anchor)

The full stack is 13 containers — two standalone trust anchors plus two
demo meshes, mainly there to exercise multi-hop chain resolution and
interfederation. If that's more than your machine wants to run, only
`ui` + `backend` + one LightHouse instance are structurally required
(`backend`'s only hard `depends_on` in `docker-compose.yml`):

```sh
python3 scripts/generate-secrets.py
docker compose up -d --build ui backend lighthouse
python3 scripts/migrate-lighthouse-config.py --single-instance
python3 scripts/bootstrap-lighthouse-admin-users.py --single-instance
python3 scripts/seed-demo.py --single-instance
```

Same login, same UI at `http://localhost:8080` — you just get one trust
anchor (`ta-1`/"LightHouse") with a couple of seeded subordinates and a
trust mark instead of the full two-federation demo. Good enough for
kicking the tires on entity/subordinate/trust-mark CRUD; not enough for
chain-resolution or interfederation scenarios, which need the mesh.

`--single-instance` isn't just "ignore the rest" — `bootstrap-lighthouse-
admin-users.py` and `seed-demo.py` only ever *talk* to the instance(s)
you tell them to, so nothing times out waiting on a container that was
never started. Every other configured instance (`ta-2`, the mesh nodes)
just shows up in the UI as unreachable if you ever select it — the app
doesn't require them to be up.

### Rebuild a single service (after source changes)

```sh
# UI (React source or nginx config changed)
docker compose up -d --build ui

# Backend (Python source changed)
docker compose up -d --build backend
```

> `restart` alone will **not** pick up source changes for `ui` or
> `backend` — both bake source into the image at build time. See
> `CLAUDE.md`.

### Reset everything from scratch

```sh
docker compose down
find lighthouse/data -mindepth 1 ! -name '.gitkeep' -delete
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
python3 scripts/migrate-lighthouse-config.py
python3 scripts/bootstrap-lighthouse-admin-users.py
python3 scripts/seed-demo.py
```

To keep LightHouse data but reset only the BFF database:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate backend
```

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite (reference implementation)
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright, against the real Docker-composed stack
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Architecture

The UI is a **backend-agnostic** frontend: any Admin API implementing
`Federation Admin OpenAPI.yaml` can plug in. The FastAPI backend in this
repo is a reference implementation and gateway (BFF), not a mock — it
proxies to a real federation node (LightHouse) and owns its own concerns
(auth, RBAC, audit, instance registry). Full details in
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
